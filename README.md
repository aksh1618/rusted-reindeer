# Rusted Reindeer

Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Rust project created by [aksh1618](https://github.com/aksh1618)

In this repository, aksh1618 is about to provide solutions for the puzzles using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) language.

This project uses [aoc-main][aoc-main-crates-io] which:
- Provides a nice bootstrapping macro that emits a structured output while still only relying on a `cargo run`
- Auto-downloads the inputs on `cargo run` using your AOC session cookie, which is convenient as the creator of AoC prefers that inputs are not checked in[^eric-input-tweet]

(The seasonal_ferris image has been generated using a [locally running][draw-fast-github] version of [drawfast][draw-fast-playground])

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-four days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.

    Eric had [tweeted][eric-input-tweet]: "In general I ask people not to publish their inputs, just to make it harder for someone to try to steal the whole site. The answer is probably fine, but also probably not very interesting since they vary per person."
